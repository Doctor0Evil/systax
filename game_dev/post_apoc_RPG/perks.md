## Perk System: "The Wasteland Survivor"

### Core Philosophy:
This system focuses on character progression through specialized skills that reflect survival in a harsh, post-apocalyptic world. Perks are categorized into five main domains, each representing different aspects of wasteland survival.

### Perk Categories:
1. **Combat Mastery**
2. **Survival Instincts**
3. **Social Skills**
4. **Physical Traits**
5. **Addiction & Mutation**

### Perk Tree Structure:
Each category has a tiered structure, with more powerful perks requiring prerequisite perks to unlock. Players can customize their characters by choosing different combinations of perks.

### Unique Perks:

#### Combat Mastery
- **Adaptive Fighter**: Gain +2 damage against enemies with armor, +1 damage against unarmored targets.
- **Tactical Overlord**: Can plan 2 additional actions per combat round.
- **Weapon Synergy**: Choose a weapon type - gain +10% accuracy and +2 damage with that weapon type.
- **Merciless Finisher**: Critical hits ignore 20% of target's armor.
- **Battlefield Awareness**: See enemy attack patterns 1 round before they execute.

#### Survival Instincts
- **Scavenger's Eye**: Find 50% more resources during exploration.
- **Radiation Resilience**: Reduce radiation damage by 25%.
- **Poison Immunity**: Resist poison effects by 50%.
- **Weather Endurance**: Take half damage from extreme weather conditions.
- **Wilderness Navigation**: Move 25% faster through difficult terrain.

- **Feral Instincts**: In combat, gain +10% chance to auto-counter attacks.
- **Radioactive Metabolism**: Radiation exposure grants temporary strength boosts.

### Special Mechanics:
- **Synergy Bonuses**: Certain perk combinations provide unique bonuses (e.g., "Adaptive Fighter" + "Weapon Synergy" = +5 critical hit chance).
- **Moral Choices**: Some perks have ethical implications (e.g., "Mercy Killer" increases damage vs. helpless enemies but reduces reputation).
- **Dynamic Progression**: Perks can evolve as the character gains experience, allowing for mid-game specialization shifts.
- **Environmental Triggers**: Some perks only activate in specific environments (e.g., "Desert Survival" provides water conservation benefits).

This system maintains the core principles of the original material while introducing new mechanics and categories that expand on the wasteland survival theme. It encourages players to develop unique playstyles by combining different perk synergies and adapting to various challenges in the game world.


### ASSISTANT
Okay, I've analyzed the provided perk list and created a unique and original perk system inspired by its structure and themes, but tailored for a similar post-apocalyptic RPG.

**Perk System: "Fractured Fortunes"**

**Core Concept:** Perks in "Fractured Fortunes" are called **Fractures** – representing how the harsh world has fundamentally altered the survivor's capabilities, sometimes beneficially, sometimes detrimentally. Players acquire Fractures primarily through significant story events, near-death experiences, or prolonged exposure to hazards, not just level-ups. This makes character progression feel more organic and tied to the narrative.

**Fracture Types:**

1.  **Adaptive Fractures (Blue):** Beneficial mutations or skills honed through necessity. These are closest to traditional perks.
2.  **Scarring Fractures (Red):** Powerful abilities gained at a significant cost, often a stat penalty, a negative trait, or a situational drawback.
3.  **Reactive Fractures (Green):** Passive abilities that trigger under specific conditions (e.g., low health, night-time, surprise attack).
4.  **Syndicate Fractures (Purple):** Rare perks obtained through specific factions or completing major questlines.

**Integration with Stats/Skills:**
Fractures interact with the standard S.P.E.C.I.A.L. stats and derived skills. Prerequisites are based on these stats or skill ranks. Some Fractures provide flat bonuses, others grant percentage bonuses or entirely new mechanics.

**Progression:**
Fractures are meant to be rare and impactful. Players might gain 1-2 major Fractures per act or significant story arc, encouraging meaningful choices rather than a checklist of minor bonuses. This aligns with the gritty, resourceful feel of the source material.
