# Virta-Sys Continuous ML Automation Deployment Playbook

## 1. Pre-requisites

- Python 3.10+ installed
- Git installed and configured
- GitHub repository access with push permissions
- GitHub Secrets configured with:
  - `OPENAI_API_KEY`: OpenAI API key for AI code generation
- Windows Driver Kit (WDK) and Visual Studio (optional, for kernel modules)
- Access to GitHub Actions runners or self-hosted runners

---

## 2. Setting Up The Local Environment

- Clone the repo:
  git clone https://github.com/Doctor0Evil/Virta-Sys.git
  cd Virta-Sys

- Install dependencies:
  python -m pip install --upgrade pip
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  pip install openai scikit-learn pandas joblib

- Ensure `OPENAI_API_KEY` env variable (locally and in GitHub Secrets) is set.

---

## 3. GitHub Actions Workflow

- The workflow `.github/workflows/ci.yml` is configured to:
  - Run on pushes, pull requests, and every 15 minutes via cron.
  - Set up Python environment and dependencies.
  - Run the ML evolution script `scripts/evolve_system.py`.
  - Upload ML artifacts (model files, metrics, generated code).
  - Auto-commit and push any code/model improvements back to repo.

---

## 4. Running Locally / Testing

- Execute ML evolution script locally for testing:
  python scripts/evolve_system.py

- Check logs for training accuracy, code generation success, and git operations.

---

## 5. Kernel-Level Integration (Optional)

- For Windows kernel driver integration with device ID and credentials:
  - Set up Windows Driver Kit (WDK) and Visual Studio.
  - Develop secure kernel driver in C/C++ using WDK.
  - Use user-mode utility to send data securely via IOCTL.
  - Follow best practices for kernel security and stability.
  - This process is separate from ML workflows but can be orchestrated via CI/CD.

---

## 6. Telemetry and Tracing

- Use `qbot_telemetry_runner.py` and Catapult trace viewer:
  - Run telemetry tests on target devices.
  - Use local dev server: `./bin/run_dev_server`
  - Trace viewer accessible at http://localhost:8003

---

## 7. Monitoring and Notifications

- Optionally extend GitHub Actions workflows to integrate Slack/email notifications on failures.
- Use uploaded artifacts for audit and analysis.
- Monitor workflow runs via GitHub Actions UI.

---

## 8. Maintenance and Updating

- Keep dependencies updated via scheduled releases.
- Improve ML models with new data periodically.
- Monitor kernel integration stability carefully.

---

## 9. Additional Tips

- Script modularity and logging aids debugging.
- Secure storage of secrets and credentials is mandatory.
- Use experiment tracking tools (MLflow, Weights & Biases) if scaling.
