## üìù Release Notes

### Highlights

- üåê New: **Virta-Net Core** module with autonomous node orchestration (0% physical dependency)
- üîó Bit.Hub/ALN integration: workflow audit, security, auto-compliance triggers
- ‚ôªÔ∏è Infinite uptime simulation and self-healing behaviors
- üß† AI agent hooks prepped for plugin extension in upcoming milestone
- üìñ Audit logging and compliance enforcement embedded in workflow steps

### Breaking Changes

- All physical hardware dependencies have been removed; legacy hardware hooks are now deprecated.
- Workflows now require OPA/Bit.Hub policy checks to be present for any deployment.

### Improvements

- Workflow modularity and parameterization for node count and audit modes
- More granular output in logs and result summaries
- Direct GPG signing and SPDX compliance checks included in release automation

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed edge-case virtual node spawn-failure during concurrent upgrades
- Resolved logging race conditions when running in dense simulation environments

### Documentation

- Added linked guides for all new modules and Bit.Hub/ALN setup in [README.md](https://github.com/Doctor0Evil/Virta-Sys/blob/main/README.md)
- Security policy and audit documentation updated in [SECURITY.md](https://github.com/Doctor0Evil/Virta-Sys/blob/main/SECURITY.md)
- Developer workflow instructions in [.github/workflows/virta-net-core.yml](https://github.com/Doctor0Evil/Virta-Sys/blob/main/.github/workflows/virta-net-core.yml)
